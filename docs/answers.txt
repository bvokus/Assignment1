(e) Reasons for branches in Git repository:
	1) Branches help to keep the project organized, while allowing multiple people in the group to work at the same time
	2) Seperate parts of the project, create a branch for testing and another branch for adding features

(f) git log - shows info on only files that have commits
    git status - shows files modified since the last commit, as well as untracked files

(g) git log --follow Weapon.h

(h) git log --all --grep = "file" 

(i) 
	(I) Inheritance - allows objects to take on the properties of existing objects. Basically a class derives from an already existing class. Child will inherit from a parent class.  
	(II) Polymorphism - how a program decides which method of a class it is going to use. Able to redefine methods for classes
	(III) Encapculation - combining data and functions into a class. Data is accessed though functions inside classes.
